### Hello there, I'm Lukas! ðŸ‘‹

As youâ€™ve probably noticed, my GitHub activity isnâ€™t exactly buzzing â€” at least, not publicly. Most of my time is spent on research projects at
university and private experiments, neither of which show up in the activity feed. That being said, Iâ€™m still deep into programming languages
and performance engineering and image compression, always looking for something new and exciting.

Feel free to reach out, connect, or just say hi. Until then â€” happy coding! ðŸš€
